# Included concepts:
This repository showcases advanced SQL queries and concepts applied during my exploration of database systems, inspired by the # **Big Data Energy(BDE)** course by **JessramosData**. 

Topics included:
1. Join
2. Case Statements
3. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
4. Set Operations
5. Subqueries: Crafting nested queries for advanced filtering and computations.
6. Self Joins: Analyzing relationships within the same table for hierarchical or comparative data.
7. Window Functions: Performing advanced calculations across data partitions.
8.  Optimization: Enhancing query performance through indexing and execution plan analysis.
9. Views and Temporary Tables: Structuring reusable and temporary query outputs for scalable data operations.

This repository serves as a snapshot of my SQL expertise, focusing on practical applications in big data systems and real-world scenarios.
